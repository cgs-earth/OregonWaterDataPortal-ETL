you can get the summary info for a monitoring location by going to a link like the following:

https://ordeq.gselements.com/api/monitoringlocationsver1?contenttype=json&includeresultsummary=t&monitoringlocationidentifierscsv=11973-ordeq

You can retrieve timeseries data from a url like https://ordeq.gselements.com/api/ContinuousResultsVer1?Characteristic=Temperature%2C+water&MonitoringLocationIdentifiersCsv=11973-ORDEQ&ContentType=json

but it doesnt seem that you can select the activity type in either the query param or the results
