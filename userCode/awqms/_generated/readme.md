For our awqms integration we map every one datastream with at least 1 observation every month in the past 2 years (i.e. 24 observations) to a standardized ODM2 vocabulary item.

The code in this directory is compromised of, or generates, code that helps us map the datastreams to the ODM2 vocabulary and accomplish this goal.
